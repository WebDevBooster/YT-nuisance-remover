# YT Nuisance Remover

This simple browser extension/add-on is designed to ***automatically remove annoying nuisance/garbage/rubbish from under the videos on YouTube***. 

Tested in Chrome but should work in other browsers like Firefox just as well. 

Here's what it does: 

## 1) Remove annoying/useless button labels:

![YouTube button labels after](./resources/yt-btn-labels-after.png)

--- 

## 2) Remove annoying baby-sitter boxes:

![YouTube clarity box before](./resources/yt-clarify-box-before.png)

![YouTube clarity box after](./resources/yt-clarify-box-after.png)

The info icon under the lower right corner of the video only appears if YouTube wants to show a 'babysitter box'. 

And even when that info icon appears, it does NOT push the other content down!
